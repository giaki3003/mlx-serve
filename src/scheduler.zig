//! Plan 01 Phase 2 — continuous-batching scheduler.
//!
//! Owns the single inference thread (the only thread that calls into mlx
//! ops; mlx 0.31.2 made GPU streams thread-local so the model weights are
//! bound to whichever thread first calls `useCurrentThreadStream` after
//! load). Connection threads parse HTTP, build prompt token ids, call
//! `submit()` and then loop on `Slot.waitNext()` to read generated tokens
//! one at a time. The state machines for tool-call detection, thinking
//! blocks, SSE streaming, etc. live on the connection thread, unchanged.
//!
//! Per-slot state (KVCache, moe_seq_offset, ssm_entries, vision_embeddings)
//! lives on `Slot` itself; each slot's `ForwardCtx` points at those fields,
//! and the `Generator` constructed for the slot stores the ctx so
//! `xfm.forwardWith(&self.ctx, ...)` routes through slot-local state. The
//! shared Transformer holds the weights only — single-writer-per-tick on
//! the inference thread guards correctness while many slots can be in
//! flight at once.
//!
//! Decode tick logic (the Phase 3 gate):
//!   * `active.len == 1` (the common single-stream case) → legacy path:
//!     `Generator.next` / `nextPld` / `nextDrafter` with the same lazy
//!     pipeline that today's serial path uses. Bit-identical to pre-Phase-2.
//!   * `active.len >= 2` → batched: `forwardBatchedDecode` produces N logits
//!     in one kernel pass, sampled per-slot. PLD / drafter are forced off in
//!     this path (the speculative paths assume a single in-flight slot's
//!     KV cache; expensive to interleave).
//!   * `cancelled` slots are skipped and culled from `decoding`.
//!
//! Output channel: each slot owns a bounded ring (`std.ArrayList(u32)` +
//! cursor + cv) the inference thread pushes into and the connection thread
//! drains. Generation end is signaled by `state == .finished` (or `.errored`)
//! plus a cv broadcast.
